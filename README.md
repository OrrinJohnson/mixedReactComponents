# A Fun Repo of different React Components

## Each folder in the repo will have an App.js file along with other components.

### These have been tested and I wanted to keep a reference of them somewhere so I decided to keep them here so I can refer back to them later. Some of these will be original and some of them will be references or slightly modified versions of components and structures that I have built through online training.
